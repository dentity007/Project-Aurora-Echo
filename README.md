# Real-Time AI Meeting Assistant

## Overview
This is a FastAPI-based application with WebSocket support that transcribes live audio from your microphone, summarizes meeting content, and extracts action items using the xAI Grok API.

## Description
Real-Time AI Meeting Assistant
The Real-Time AI Meeting Assistant is an innovative FastAPI-based application designed to transform meeting productivity by transcribing live audio, generating concise summaries, and extracting actionable items in real time. Powered by the advanced Whisper model for speech-to-text and the xAI Grok API for natural language processing, this tool leverages cutting-edge AI to streamline collaboration and task management. Ideal for professionals, teams, and remote workers, it offers a seamless experience with text-to-speech feedback and a dynamic web interface.
Key Features

Live Audio Transcription: Captures and transcribes 5-second audio clips from your microphone using the Whisper model, optimized for GPU acceleration on compatible hardware.
Intelligent Summarization: Utilizes the xAI Grok API to distill meeting discussions into concise summaries, enhancing comprehension and retention.
Action Item Extraction: Automatically identifies and organizes tasks, assignees, and due dates, presented in an interactive table for easy tracking.
Text-to-Speech Feedback: Provides audible summaries via pyttsx3, ensuring accessibility and hands-free operation.
User-Friendly Interface: Built with FastAPI and WebSockets, offering a responsive web-based UI accessible at http://localhost:8000.

Technical Highlights
Developed on Ubuntu 24.04.3 LTS, the application harnesses a robust tech stack including PyAudio for audio capture, pandas for data management, and torch for GPU support. Itâ€™s designed to run efficiently on high-performance systems like the Lenovo ThinkPad P16 Gen 2, utilizing its NVIDIA RTX 5000 for accelerated processing. The code is modular, with cached resources to optimize performance, and includes comprehensive error handling for a reliable user experience.
